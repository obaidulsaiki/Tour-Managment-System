# Online Tour Management System with Store Integration

This project is a comprehensive web-based Tour Management System developed for the partial fulfillment of the CSC 470 Software Engineering Lab course. It is designed to streamline the tour booking process for travelers and provide an efficient management platform for administrators in Bangladesh. The system includes a fully integrated e-commerce store for selling travel-related products.

## Implemented Features

Our platform is equipped with a variety of features to serve both customers and administrators.

### For Customers:
* **User Authentication**: Securely sign up, log in, and manage accounts. A password recovery option is also available.
* **Tour Exploration and Booking**: Users can browse various tour packages, search for their favorite destinations, and book them online.
* **Integrated Online Store**: A built-in shop allows customers to buy travel accessories and products like t-shirts, tracking shoes, and travel kits.
* **Search and Filter**: Easily search for specific tour packages and filter them based on various criteria.
* **Photo Gallery**: A media section is available to view pictures and showcase tour locations.
* **Reviews and Ratings**: Customers can provide ratings and reviews for the tours they have completed.

### For Administrators:

## Tools and Technologies

The system is built on a foundation of common and reliable open-source technologies.

* **Frontend**: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` (with `Bootstrap`).
* **Backend**: `PHP`.
* **Database**: `MySQL`.
* **Development Environment**: `XAMPP` was used to run the local server for development.
* **Design**: Initial UI/UX was designed using `Figma` before implementation.
* **Version Control**: `GitHub` was used for code versioning and collaboration.

## Future Enhancements

We have identified several areas for future development to expand the system's capabilities.

* **Online Payment Gateway Integration**: Add support for online payment systems like bKash, Nagad, or card payments through services like SSLCommerz, potentially using Stripe technology.
* **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile app version of the system to improve accessibility for users.
* **Multi-Agency Support**: Enhance the platform to allow different tour companies to register and use the system as a centralized marketplace.
* **AI-Based Recommendations**: Implement an AI-powered recommendation system, possibly using LLMs, to suggest personalized tours based on user preferences and behavior.
