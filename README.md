# Online Tour Management System with Store Integration

[cite_start]This project is a comprehensive web-based Tour Management System developed for the partial fulfillment of the CSC 470 Software Engineering Lab course[cite: 4]. [cite_start]It is designed to streamline the tour booking process for travelers and provide an efficient management platform for administrators in Bangladesh[cite: 15, 74]. [cite_start]The system includes a fully integrated e-commerce store for selling travel-related products[cite: 22, 78].

## Implemented Features

Our platform is equipped with a variety of features to serve both customers and administrators.

* [cite_start]**Backend**: `PHP`[cite: 23, 109].
* [cite_start]**Database**: `MySQL`[cite: 61, 110].
* [cite_start]**Development Environment**: `XAMPP` was used to run the local server for development[cite: 656].
* [cite_start]**Design**: Initial UI/UX was designed using `Figma` before implementation[cite: 368].
* [cite_start]**Version Control**: `GitHub` was used for code versioning and collaboration[cite: 660].

## Future Enhancements

We have identified several areas for future development to expand the system's capabilities.
